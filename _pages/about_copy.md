I am a Postdoc with [AUTOLAB](https://autolab.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, working with [Professor Ken Goldberg](https://goldberg.berkeley.edu/). My research interests are in algorithmic problems arising in robotics, including: motion planning, computational geometry, optimization, and autonomous agents.

I am also interested in theoretical topics in computer science, including: information theory, data compression, and computational complexity.
