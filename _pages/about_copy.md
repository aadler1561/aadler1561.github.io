I am a Postdoc with [AUTOLAB](https://autolab.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley, working with [Professor Ken Goldberg](https://goldberg.berkeley.edu/). My research interests are in algorithmic problems arising in robotics, including: motion planning, computational geometry, optimization, and autonomous agents.

I completed my thesis in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT under the supervision of Prof. [Sertac Karaman](https://karaman.mit.edu/), on the [Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) under dynamic constraints](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/150313/Adler-adlera-PhD-EECS-2023-thesis.pdf?sequence=1).

I am also interested in theoretical topics in computer science, including: information theory, data compression, and computational complexity.
